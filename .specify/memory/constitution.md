# ashigaru Constitution

> **Version:** 2.2.0
> **Ratified:** 2026-10-10

> **Inherits:** [crunchtools/constitution](https://github.com/crunchtools/constitution) v1.23.0
> **Profile:** Workflow Automation

This file holds what is specific to ashigaru. The fleet rules and the Workflow
Automation profile apply at the inherited version and are checked against this
repo's files by `constitution.yml`. They are not restated here.

## Purpose

Reusable workflows that triage a repository's issues and fix the bug-class
ones: open the pull request, answer the review, and leave the merge to GitHub's
required checks. Feature work is labeled and left for a maintainer.

## Authority Split

- **Agent jobs** (`Classify`, `Code agent`, `Fix agent`) run Claude Code with
  the job token at read-only permissions and `persist-credentials: false`.
  Their only other secret is the Claude token, plus the reviewer key inside the
  pre-commit hook step of `Code agent`. Tools default to file tools; triage
  cannot edit.
- **Writing jobs** (`Apply verdict`, `Open pull request`, `Push and answer
  findings`, `Queue untriaged issues`) run no model. The two publishing jobs
  hold the Ashigaru app token, minted per job with contents, issues and
  pull-requests write and nothing else; the sweep mints it with issues write,
  pull-requests read and contents read.
- What crosses from an agent job to a writing job is schema-validated
  structured output and a patch file. The writing job applies the patch on a
  fresh runner and refuses one that touches `.github/`.
- No job merges. The app has no Workflows permission and is not an
  organization admin.

## Configured Limits

| Limit | Value | Test |
|-------|-------|------|
| Switch `ASHIGARU_ENABLED` on the first job of every workflow | must be `true` | `test_the_switch_gates_the_first_job_and_every_job_has_a_timeout` |
| Turn limit and tool list on every agent step | 40 or 80 turns | `test_every_agent_step_has_a_turn_limit_and_a_tool_list` |
| Job timeouts | 5 to 75 minutes | same as the switch |
| Fix rounds per pull request | 5, then `needs-human` | `test_round_cap_hands_off_instead_of_fixing` |
| Issues queued for triage per sweep | 20 at most | `test_no_run_queues_more_than_the_hard_maximum` |
| Fixes started by the sweep per hour | 5 by default, less those opened in the past hour | `test_the_hourly_budget_is_what_the_past_hour_left` |
| Authors without write access | never read unless someone with write access labels the issue | `tests/test_guard.py` |

## Public Interface

Label names (`ready-for-triage`, `ready-to-code`, `triaged`, `needs-info`,
`needs-human`), workflow inputs and secrets, the `ashigaru/` branch prefix, the
round marker comment and the job names are what consumers and branch rules
depend on. Changing one is a MAJOR release.

## Release Coupling

A called workflow cannot name its own ref. Each reusable workflow fetches the
scripts at a literal tag that equals `VERSION`; `tests/test_workflows.py` holds
the workflows, the example, this repo's caller and the CHANGELOG together.
