# Code

Code turns a `ready-to-code` issue into a pull request that closes it, with auto-merge on.

## Why it matters

A coding agent that can also push is one prompt injection away from pushing something nobody asked for. Here the agent can only edit files on a runner that holds nothing worth stealing, and a separate job with no model in it does the pushing.

## How it works

`code.yml` has two jobs on two runners.

**Code agent** (read-only token, tools `Read,Edit,Write,Glob,Grep` by default):

1. The guard checks the event, then the issue and its maintainer comments are assembled into the prompt.
2. The agent edits the checkout and returns `status`, `summary` and `reason`.
3. The repository's pre-commit hooks run over the change, using the hook configuration as it was before the agent ran. If they fail, the output goes back to the same session with `--resume`, at most twice.
4. The change leaves the job as a patch file and a JSON result. Nothing else does.

**Open pull request** (app token, no model): `scripts/publish.py` applies the patch on a fresh checkout, commits, pushes `ashigaru/issue-N`, opens the pull request with `Closes #N` and runs `gh pr merge --auto --squash`.

The publish job refuses, labels the issue `needs-human` and says why when the agent reported no fix, when the patch is empty, or when it touches `.github/`. If a pull request is already open for the branch and still merges, it does nothing. If the open pull request conflicts with the default branch, the job rebuilds the branch from the new patch, force-pushes it and says so on the pull request; the earlier commits and their review threads are replaced.

Hook failures that survive two passes do not block the pull request: the repository's required checks are the arbiter, and [fix](fix.md) handles what they report.

## Example

```yaml
code:
  uses: crunchtools/ashigaru/.github/workflows/code.yml@v2.4.0
  with:
    model: "sonnet"
    max_turns: 80
  secrets:
    CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN }}
    ASHIGARU_APP_ID: ${{ secrets.ASHIGARU_APP_ID }}
    ASHIGARU_APP_KEY: ${{ secrets.ASHIGARU_APP_KEY }}
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}   # for the Gatehouse hook; optional
```

`allowed_tools` can be widened per repository, for example to let the agent run tests. `Bash` runs repository code next to the Claude token, so widen it only where every issue author is trusted.
