# <config-file> is the hook config as it was BEFORE the agent ran. Two passes:
#   1. every hook except Gatehouse, with the reviewer key absent from the
#      environment and from disk. These hooks run repository code.
#   2. Gatehouse alone, with the key on disk for that one command. Its entry
#      pipes the staged diff to a container and runs no repository code.
